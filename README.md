# hello-world
Thousand times I write this, muawahahaha

Yes, it thousand times :P
Visual Basic was the first programming language I learn,
then Action Script, PHP, HTML, CSS, jQuery,
sometimes I want to learn Phyton.
Everytimes learning new code, start with "Hello World" right :D

Because I'm working as Graphic Designer, I forgot almost of my code T^T
now I want to re-learn coding again

I'm learning React now
hope nice road there
